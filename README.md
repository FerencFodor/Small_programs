# Small Programs
**Small programs that I write for C/C#/Java/Python**

These programs are mostly from seminar's and are *mostly* useless for everyday use such as the one [Calculating square root using turtle graphics](https://github.com/Jacob5122/Small_programs/blob/master/School/Python_1/Seminar_1/turtle_4-5.py).
